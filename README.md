# Welcome to GroupIT repository :)


### Tour through:
### folders:

- assymetry
    - single code for assymetry test, as well as the code that you can run the assymetry
      test over a whole dataset.
    - comparison_assymetry.csv ran over group_G dataset, code results compared with 
      human opinion.
    - additional folder with resized_masks and cropped_and_rotated_masks that helped us
      during the process of running the assymetry code. (checking if the minimum bounding
      box is looking good)
  
  
- blue-white veil 
    - single code for blue-white veil test, as well as the code that you can run the blue-
      white veil test over a whole dataset.
    - comparison_blue_white_veil.csv ran over group_G dataset, code results compared with 
      human opinion.
    - additional folder "blue_white_veil_internet" with additional dataset (melanoma that
      have blue white veils detected by doctors) to check if the code is detecting
      correctly downloaded from: 
       https://dermoscopedia.org/02-Blue_white_structures

       (ResearchGate)
      with it's results.
      
- color
    - single code for color test, as well as the code that you can run the color
      test over a whole dataset.
    - comparison_color.csv ran over group_G dataset, code results compared with 
      human opinion.
      
- graphs (graphs used in report)

- images_oginal & masks_orginal (orginal images and masks for group G provided on the
  beginig of this cours)
    
- midway (file containing files uploaded for the midway of the project)

- result_for_other_groups_images (code 3_in_1_code_output) ran over other groups images,
  and masks giving us a slightly bigger data set to work on.
